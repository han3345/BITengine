# Simple Lunrjs Display

This is a demo how to easily display [lunrjs](https://lunrjs.com/) index using javascript and generic styling using [pico css](https://picocss.com/)

To use this just replace `search_index.json` file with your own lunrjs index. This demo expects documents to be composed of fields `title` and `text`
